# Column descriptions: 
#  1  chr: chromosome
#  2  pos: genomic position
#  3  ref: genomic reference base
#  4  alt: genomic mutation base
#  5  gene: gene identifier
#  6  posaa: protein position
#  7  refaa: reference amino acid
#  8  altaa: mutated amino acid
#  9  impact: is the mutation predicted to impact function? '1' if yes, '0' if no
#  10 pdb_id: pdb identifier or homology model identifier of the structure containing the mutation
#  11 chain: pdb chain
#  12 pdb_position: position of the mutation in the pdb structure, this can often be different from the sequence position
#  13 ddg: predicted change in free energy of unfolding, where a value above 0 indicates a destabilising mutation
#  14 evidence: 'exp' for experimental model or 'hom' for homology models
