# Phosphosite table
# Column descriptions: 
#  1  chr: chromosome
#  2  pos: genomic position
#  3  ref: genomic reference base
#  4  alt: genomic mutation base
#  5  gene: gene identifier
#  6  posaa: protein position
#  7  refaa: reference amino acid
#  8  altaa: mutated amino acid
#  9  impact: is the mutation predicted to impact function? '1' if yes, '0' if no
#  10 site: modified residue followed by position
#  11 sequence: sequence of modified site and flanking residues
#  12 experimental_kinases: kinases experimentally identified to target this phosphosite
#  13 site_function: function of this phosphorylation site, if any
#  14 site_evidence: evidence of this phosphorylation site, as comma-separated pubmed ids
#  15 kinase_evidence: evidence of kinase phosphorylation on this site, if any
#  16 function_evidence: evidence of site function, if any
#  17 predicted_kinase: kinase predicted to lose phosphorylation at this site
#  18 wt_score: binding score of kinase to wildtype sequence
#  18 mt_score: binding score of kinase to mutated sequence, if the mutation affects the central residue the sequence is not scored though a score of zero can be assumed
#  19 probability_loss: probability of kinase losing phosphorylation at this site
#  20 log_ratio: log ratio between wildtype and mutant scores
