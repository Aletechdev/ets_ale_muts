# Protein-protein interaction interface table
# Column descriptions: 
#  1  chr: chromosome
#  2  pos: genomic position
#  3  ref: genomic reference base
#  4  alt: genomic mutation base
#  5  gene: gene identifier
#  6  posaa: protein position
#  7  refaa: reference amino acid
#  8  altaa: mutated amino acid
#  9  impact: is the mutation predicted to impact function? '1' if yes, '0' if no
#  10 pdb_id: pdb identifier for the structure containing the interaction between proteins
#  11 sa_difference: percentage difference in predicted surface accessibility (computed by Naccess) between interacting and separated chains
#  12 protein_a: identifier of the source protein containing the mutation
#  13 protein_b: identifier of interacting partner protein
#  14 chain: mutated chain in the pdb file
#  15 ddg: predicted change in free energy of unfolding, where a value above 0 indicates a destabilising mutation
#  16 evidence: 'exp' for experimental model, 'hom' for homology models and 'ddm' for domain-domain homology models
#  17 pdb_position: corresponding position of the variant in the pdb file
