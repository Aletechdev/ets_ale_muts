# Transcription factor binding sites table
# Column descriptions: 
#  1  chr: chromosome
#  2  pos: genomic position
#  3  ref: genomic reference base
#  4  alt: genomic mutation base
#  5  gene: gene identifier
#  6  posaa: protein position
#  7  refaa: reference amino acid
#  8  altaa: mutated amino acid
#  9  impact: is the mutation predicted to impact function? '1' if yes, '0' if no
#  10 ref_strand: reference base on the scored strand, this will differ from ref when on negative strand
#  11 alt_strand: mutated base on the scored strand, this will differ from alt when on the negative strand
#  12 start: start position of the binding site
#  13 end: end position of the binding site
#  14 sequence: sequence of the binding site
#  14 tf: transcription factor predicted to bind this binding site
#  15 knockout_pvalue: p-value of over or under-expression for the downstream gene when the transcription factor is knocked out
#  16 chip_evidence: evidence of this binding site being located in a chip-chip region for this transcription factor as a pubmed id
#  17 gene_strand: strand containing the downstream gene
#  18 scored_strand: strand containing binding site
#  19 wt_score: binding score of the transcription factor to the wildtype site
#  20 mt_score: binding score of the transcription factor to the mutated site
#  21 score_difference: score difference between wildtype and mutant
#  22 ic_difference: information content difference between the wildtype and mutant bases
#  23 percentile_difference: score percentile difference between score wildtype and mutant
#  24 cells: cell lines or tissues with evidence of chip-seq (human only)
